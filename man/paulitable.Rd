\title{Get variable names, labels, and optional summary stats
Idea was that RSTudio unlike STATA has not a variable viewer which quickly
lets you see the variables with corresponding variable labels
This function returns a table of variable names and their variable labels,
with optional summary statistics like mean, range, and missing percentage.}
